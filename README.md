# ML Ops End-to-End Workflow

This repository demonstrates an **end-to-end Machine Learning Operations (ML Ops) pipeline** designed for building, deploying, and monitoring machine learning models. ML Ops integrates machine learning with DevOps principles to streamline the development, deployment, and management of ML systems in production environments.

## Project Overview

The core aim of this project is to **operationalize machine learning models** by creating automated pipelines that continuously develop, test, deploy, and monitor models in a production environment. ML Ops practices ensure that machine learning models are scalable, reliable, and maintainable.

This project uses various tools for the different stages of the pipeline, including:

- **Languages**: Python
- **Modeling**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
- **Containerization and Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitLab CI
- **Model Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Version Control**: Git, DVC (Data Version Control)
- **Cloud Services**: AWS S3, GCP, Azure

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_repo/mlops-project.git
    cd mlops-project
    ```

2. Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Install Docker and Kubernetes on your system for model packaging and deployment.

4. Set up cloud credentials (e.g., AWS, GCP) if you plan to use cloud-based services for model storage or inference.

## Key Concepts and Tools

### 1. **Versioning**:
   - **Model Versioning**: Tools like DVC or MLflow are used to version models and datasets, ensuring reproducibility.
   - **Code Versioning**: Git is used for tracking code changes.

### 2. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
   - Automated workflows using tools like **Jenkins** or **GitLab CI** for testing and deploying models into production.

### 3. **Containerization and Orchestration**:
   - Use of **Docker** to create lightweight, portable containers for ML models, and **Kubernetes** to orchestrate model deployment in production.

### 4. **Monitoring and Retraining**:
   - **Prometheus** and **Grafana** are used for real-time monitoring of deployed models. Degradation in model performance triggers an automatic retraining process.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Data Ingestion and Processing

**Tools**: Pandas, NumPy, Apache Spark

- **Data Ingestion**: Collect and load data from multiple sources like databases, APIs, or files.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize, and transform the data to ensure it’s ready for model training.
- **Pipeline**: Set up data pipelines using tools like **Apache Airflow** or **Kubeflow Pipelines** for automated and scalable data processing.

**Key scripts**: 
- `data_preprocessing.py`
- `data_ingestion.py`

---

### 2. Model Training and Validation

**Tools**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

- **Modeling**: Develop the machine learning models using frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn.
- **Training and Validation**: Train the model on the training dataset and validate on the test/validation set. Perform hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV** or **RandomSearchCV**.
- **Distributed Training**: Train the models across multiple GPUs or distributed clusters if needed.

**Key scripts**: 
- `train_model.py`
- `validation.py`

---

### 3. Model Packaging and Deployment

**Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Flask/FastAPI

- **Model Export**: Save trained models in formats like **.h5**, **.pkl**, or **ONNX** for deployment.
- **Containerization**: Package the model into a **Docker** container for consistent deployment across environments.
- **Deployment**: Deploy using **Kubernetes** to ensure scalability and reliability. Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment using tools like **Jenkins** or **GitLab CI**.

**Key scripts**: 
- `deploy_model.py`
- `Dockerfile`

---

### 4. Model Monitoring, Maintenance, and Retraining

**Tools**: Prometheus, Grafana, MLflow

- **Monitoring**: Use **Prometheus** to track key performance indicators (KPIs) like accuracy, latency, and memory usage. Visualize metrics in **Grafana**.
- **Alerts**: Set up alert systems to notify when model performance degrades (e.g., concept drift).
- **Retraining**: Use automated retraining pipelines triggered when model performance falls below a threshold. Retrained models are validated and redeployed using CI/CD.

**Key scripts**: 
- `monitoring.py`
- `retrain_model.py`

## Challenges in ML Ops

Some common challenges faced during the ML Ops lifecycle include:

- **Data and Model Drift**: The model’s performance may degrade over time due to changing data distributions (data drift) or evolving patterns (concept drift). Continuous monitoring and retraining help mitigate this.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensuring that models, data pipelines, and training processes can be reproduced across different environments.
- **Scalability**: Dealing with large-scale data and model deployment across multiple regions or nodes.
- **Security**: Protecting data integrity and ensuring compliance with regulations like GDPR when handling sensitive data.
